# Problem / Opportunity

#### Create Awareness of the Problem

**Demand:**

- Households w/ Dogs: 47%
- Douglasville Pop.: 30,000
- Avg. People / Home: 4
- Apx. Homes in Douglas Co.: 7,500
- Apx. Homes w/ Dogs: 3,750
- Attraction Rate (5%): 187
- Attraction Rate (0.2%): 9

**Comparing the Competition:**

- *Ongoing Support:* Only 1 of the top 5 on Google offered ongoing phone support at $50 / hour.  One other offered behavior modification packages in addition to the "basic obedience package" at a higher, but reasonable, rate.
  - Over-the-Air Support (especially via social media) should be **free and guaranteed.**
  - Active phone time is valuable, but should not be charged at nearly the same rate as in-person sessions.
  - Ongoing training should be drastically discounted to reward loyalty.
- *Group vs. Individual vs. Boarding:*  Boarding is less common and very expensive, should be ruled out of initial business plan, but considered in the future.  Group classes are rare.  Individual / private lessons are available, but often at a more expensive rate that "package deals."
  - Estimating one sesison per week for 6 weeks, or 8 sessions total leaves **a lot of time to un-train your dog.**  Additionally, 1.5 and 2 hour sessions aren't necessary, especially for simple tasks such as household obedience -- in fact animals (and people) learn more efficiently with shorter, more frequent sessions.
- *Handler / Owner Education:*  Similarly to the above, **if there is only one 2 hour session / week**, I would **spend at least one of those yours teaching the handler** how to reinforce what the dog has learned in the session throughout the coming week.
- *Equipment:*  Most packages deals include an e-collar, sometimes a long line too.  If cost effective, this should be a "package deal" too; e.g. flat collar, 6' leash, long line, e-collar, and maybe a pinch collar too.
- *Cost:*  Averaging 10 identified rates, one hour of training typically costs $63.  This could be greatly reduced while pursuiing credentials, **or** it could be kept consistent with an equipment list suggested to owners.  That seems a bit complicated, so it may be easier to increase the price slightly, and include more equipment perks.
- *Social Media Reach:*  This appears largely inconsistent, with Ranger and Clever Canidae having around 300 Instagram followers while Off-Leash has 3,500, while PetSmart of course has significantly more (529k).  Sit-Means-Sit has various regional accounts and large YouTube library.
- *Initial Assessment:*  Many businesses offer this free, which is a good idea.  It is also a good idea to require the assessment to be done in person.

#### Unfair Advantage / Why You?

Based on competition comparisons above:

- **Focus:** On *educating owners* and *building relatoinships* with dogs rather than teaching arbitrary skill set.  This allows the potential for trouble shooting, critical and creative thikning, as well as improved overall well being for both human and canine.
-  **Ongoing Support:**  Ensures we practice what we preach and build relationships with customers and dogs.  Respecting those relatoinships with heave (30% / 50%) discounts is something no one else is doing.

**Developing Credentials:**

- Trikos Team Dog CPR Certificate (pending)
- Trikos Team Dog Frist Aid Certificate (pending)
- Trikos Team Dog Foundation Course (pending)
- Trikos Team Dog Basic Obedience Course (pending)
- Trikos Team Dog Behavior Modification Course (pending)
- Trikos Team Dog Advanced Obedience Certificate (not available, coming soon)
