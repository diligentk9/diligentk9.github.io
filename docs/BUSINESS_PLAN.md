# Traget Market and Sales:  Problems and Opportunity

**Target Market:** Pet dog owners in the greater Atlanta area.

#### Demand:

Approximately 47% of households have dogs.  Of 30,000 people in Douglasville, GA that have an average of 4 people / home; that's 7,500 homes, approximately 3,750 with dogs.  Assuming a modest attraction rate of 5%, that's 187 potential customers.

#### Problems in the Current Market:

**Ongoing Support:**  Only 1 of the top 5 (on a Google search) dog training businesses in the Atlanta area offered ongoing phone support, and at a rate of $50 / hour.  Other places around the country sometimes offer limited extended support (e.g. for 3 - 6 months) after the initial 4 - 8 session training contract is complete.

*Solution:*  In an age of FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Instagram Live, YoutTube, etc... there is no reason to not be able to provide extended, long term support; be that via phone, text, email, or video confernecing.  This type of "distance learning" can be provided at a very low cost to the provider, ensures good customer relations, and could even become a subscription-type service generating more revenue.

**Expensive:**  Cost averaging 10 different rates from 5 different comapnies came to $63 / hour.  Clearly this can very with experience and credentials, but seems excessive given the limited application and fixed interaction nature of the business (see below).  Many offer included equipment (such as e-collars) with their packages, but it is a non-negotiable expense.

*Solution:*  This is in conjunction with ongoing support.  If I am paying someone $60 an hour to "fix" my dog in 4 hours over 4 weeks, without any communication or reinforcement between those sessions, and no follow up support after; then both the customer and provider are misguided.  Either the cost of training needs to go down, or collateral support needs to be increased.

**Fixed Interaction:**  Nearly every service offers individual / per-hour private lessons.  However, many offer packaged deals (e.g. 'basic obedience', 'behavior modification', etc...) sold 4 - 8 sesions at a time.  It is questionable how much a behavior can be changed in only 4 session, especially without the collateral support of knowing what the dog (and owner) are learning or unlearing during the rest of the week.

*Solution:*  Offer a fair rate and stay until the job is done.  You wouldn't leave a house half built.  Don't coerce or extort people for more money and don't sell them a half finished house... or dog.

**Limited Application:**  Likewise, behavior modification pacakges seem to focus on teaching (arbitrary?) sets of behaivors.  It is not explicitly stated how much focus is placed on handler / owner education.  This creates problems down the road when owners don't know how to think critically and troubleshoot problems because they haven't learned the priniciples that inform training practices.  

*Solution:* In the words of Abraham Lincoln: "Give me six hours to cut down a tree and I'll spend the first three sharpening my axe."  There is no axe sharpening here, only paying someone else to cut down the tree and show you how to hold the axe and burn the wood.  Educate dog owners.  As noted above, this can be done from home via phone or video conferencing.  It is still a marketable service that can be charged for and will leave much less frustration for the customer in the future.

**Lack of Transparency:**  1 of the 5 companies research did not provide prices for their services on their website.  This seems unscrupulous.  Hang in hand with the above point, handler education is a glaring missing part.  Lack of transparency in any other business is a red flag.

*Solution:*  Training practices should not be kept secret.  Quality, reliable, and accurate information and methods should be shared, not hoarded or hidden.  Dog owners should be educated and empowered, not kept behind a curtain and continually milked for more money.
